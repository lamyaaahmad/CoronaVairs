                    People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by
                    providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and
                    sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not
                    target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19
                    actually spreads can help stop stigma.

                    People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends
                    and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where
                    COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                    disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for

                    Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of

                    lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                    blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip

                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause
                    illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline
                    coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect
                    people and can spread between people. This is suspected to

                    East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute

                    coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread

                    This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
                    China. The first infections were linked to a live animal
                    market, but the virus is now spreading from
                    person-to-person. It's important to note that
                    person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some
                    viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other
                    viruses are less so.

                    <span class="text-primary">some affected geographic areas.</span>
                    Community spread means people have been infected with the

                    where they became infected.

                    It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact
                    the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common

                    that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with

                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                    person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently
                    there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                    associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is
                    important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                    20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash
                    your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                    going to the bathroom.

                  <p>
                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                    touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
                    then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                    but this is not thought to be the main way the virus

                  <p>
                    In general, because of poor survivability of these
                    coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of

                    Household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a

                    with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person
                    under investigation. Close contacts should monitor their
                    health; they should call their healthcare provider right
                    away if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g.,
                    fever, cough, shortness of breath)
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                    Make sure that you understand and can help the patient
                    follow their healthcare provider’s instructions for
                    medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with
                    basic needs in the home and provide support for getting
                    groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.

                  <p>
                    Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting
                    sicker, call his or her healthcare provider and tell them
                    that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This
                    will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to
                    keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting
                    infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or

                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness,
                    and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                    congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
                    symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                    become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't
                    feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                    disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                    every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and
                    develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                    underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart
                    problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious
                    illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing
                    should seek medical attention.

                    Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result
                    means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in

                    For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected

                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from

                    there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                    associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is
                    important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                    20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash
                    your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                    going to the bathroom.

                  <p>
                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                    touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
                    then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                    but this is not thought to be the main way the virus

                  <p>
                    In general, because of poor survivability of these
                    coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of
                    spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over

                    Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home
                    if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from
                    home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets
                    sick with

                    or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily.
                    Employers should be aware that more employees may need to
                    stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family
                    members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.

                    From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be
                    transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid
                    weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if
                    you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The
                    best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by
                    frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate
                    viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that
                    could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

                    There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the
                    new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body
                    temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the
                    external temperature or weather. The most effective way to
                    protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by
                    frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub
                    or washing them with soap and water.

                  <p>
                    To date there has been no information nor evidence to
                    suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by
                    mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which
                    spreads primarily through droplets generated when an
                    infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of
                    saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself,
                    clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub
                    or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact
                    with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

                    No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.
                    To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should
                    frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub
                    or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are
                    cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper
                    towels or a warm air dryer.
